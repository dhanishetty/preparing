For an **entry-level Python position**, especially for jobs like **Junior Python Developer**, **Software Engineer I**, or **Data Analyst (Python)**, you should focus on these core topics:

---

### 1. **Python Fundamentals**
- Variables, Data Types (int, float, str, list, dict, tuple, set)
- Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `//`, `%`, `**`), comparison operators (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`), logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`), and assignment operators (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.).
- Control Flow: Master conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) and loops (`for`, `while`). Understand how to use `break` and `continue` within loops.
- Functions: defining and calling with parameters and return values. Understand the concept of scope (local vs. global variables). `*args`, `**kwargs`
- Error Handling: `try-except`, `finally`
- Input/Output (file reading and writing)

---

### 2. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
- Classes and Objects
- Constructors (`__init__`)
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation

---

### 3. **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Basics**
- Lists and Tuples: Understand how to manipulate lists (indexing, slicing, appending, inserting, deleting, sorting) and tuples.
- Dictionaries: Know how to work with key-value pairs, accessing values, adding/removing items, and iterating through dictionaries.
- Sets: Understand set operations like union, intersection, difference.
- Searching and Sorting Algorithms (basic ones: linear search, binary search, bubble sort, etc.)
- Problem solving on platforms like LeetCode (easy level)

---

### 4. **Python Libraries**
- `collections` (e.g., `Counter`, `defaultdict`)
- `math`, `random`
- `datetime`,  `os`
- If it's a data-focused role: basic of `pandas` and `numpy`
- NumPy: For numerical operations and working with arrays. Understand basic array creation, indexing, and simple mathematical operations.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis. Be familiar with Series and DataFrames, basic data selection, and filtering.
- Requests: For making HTTP requests to interact with web services. Understand basic GET and POST requests.

---

### 5. **Working with Files and JSON**
- Reading/writing `.txt` and `.csv` files
- Working with JSON data using `json` library
- Learn how to open, read from, and write to files. Understand different file modes (`'r'`, `'w'`, `'a'`, `'r+'`, `'w+'`). Use `with` statements for proper file management.

---

### 6. **Virtual Environments and Package Management**
- Creating a virtual environment (`venv`, `pipenv`)
- Installing libraries using `pip`

---

### 7. **Basic Version Control (Git)**
- Git commands: `clone`, `add`, `commit`, `push`, `pull`
- Writing meaningful commit messages
- Understand the basic Git workflow: creating repositories, staging changes, committing, branching, and merging. Familiarity with platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket is a plus.

---

### 8. **Testing and Debugging**
- Basic Unit Testing: `unittest`, maybe intro to `pytest`
- Debugging code (using `print` statements, or Python debugger `pdb`)

---

### 9. **Databases (Basic Interaction):**
- Understand the fundamentals of relational databases (like SQL).
- Know how to connect to a database (e.g., SQLite) using Python libraries (like `sqlite3`) and perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

---

### 10. **Understanding of Basic Web Concepts (Optional but Good)**
- Flask or Django (Basics): Familiarity with a microframework like Flask or a more comprehensive framework like Django can be advantageous. Understand basic routing, request handling, and rendering simple web pages.
- HTTP Requests: `requests` library
- Basics of APIs (if the role involves any backend or API consumption)

---

### 11. **Soft Skills (often overlooked but important)**
- Clear code commenting and documentation
- Understanding and following coding standards (e.g., PEP8)
- Good communication to explain code and logic during interviews

---

**Bonus Topics (depending on job description)**:
- Basics of SQL
- Flask or Django (for web development roles)
- Basics of cloud (AWS S3, Lambda â€” just high-level)

Would you like me to also suggest a **sample 30-day study plan** if you're preparing quickly for an interview? ðŸš€  
It can make this more actionable!
